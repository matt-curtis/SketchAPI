### The Roadmap

Our mission is to provide the best possible developer experience for people that want to create Sketch plugins.

We are using [Trello](https://trello.com/b/K1usljNW/sketch-plugins-roadmap) to give you a high level view of our plan.

We want to get your feedback on our plans to achieve this mission. The roadmap aims to share some of the things we're working on or thinking of working on. You can vote on these and we may use these votes as a guideline to help us prioritize.

If you have ideas or suggestions please read the [Suggesting Enhancements](#suggesting-enhancements) section below to understand how to contribute your feedback.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for the Sketch API. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report :pencil:, reproduce the behavior :computer: :computer:, and find related reports :mag_right:.

Before creating bug reports, please check [this list](#before-submitting-a-bug-report) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report).

#### Before Submitting A Bug Report

**Perform a [cursory search](https://github.com/BohemianCoding/SketchAPI/labels/bug)** to see if the problem has already been reported. If it does exist, add a :thumbsup: to the issue to indicate this is also an issue for you, and add a comment to the existing issue if there is extra information you can contribute.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).

Simply create an issue on the [Sketch API issue tracker](https://github.com/BohemianCoding/SketchAPI/issues).

The information we are interested in includes:

* details about your environment - which Sketch version, which operating system
* details about reproducing the issue - what steps to take, what happens, how often it happens
* other relevant information - log files, screenshots, etc.

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for the Sketch API, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your suggestion :pencil: and find related suggestions :mag_right:.

Before creating enhancement suggestions, please check [this list](#before-submitting-an-enhancement-suggestion) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating an enhancement suggestion, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-enhancement-suggestion).

#### Before Submitting An Enhancement Suggestion

**Perform a [cursory search](https://github.com/BohemianCoding/SketchAPI/labels/enhancement)** to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a :thumbsup: to indicate your interest in it, or comment if there is additional information you would like to add.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).

Simply create an issue on the [Sketch issue tracker](https://github.com/BohemianCoding/SketchAPI/issues) and provide the following information:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
* **Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as much detail as possible. This additional context helps the maintainers to understand the enhancement from your perspective
* **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to Sketch plugin developers.
* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** if relevant to help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part of Sketch which the suggestion is related to. You can use [this tool](https://getkap.co) to record GIFs.
* **List some plugins where this enhancement would be useful, if applicable.**

### Help Wanted

As part of building the Sketch API, we'll identify tasks that are good for external contributors to pick up. These tasks:

* have low impact, or have a known workaround
* should be addressed
* have a narrow scope and/or easy reproduction steps
* can be worked on independent of other tasks

These issues will be labelled as [`help wanted`](https://github.com/BohemianCoding/SketchAPI/labels/help%20wanted) in the repository. If you are interested in contributing to the project, please comment on the issue to let the core team (and the community) know you are interested in the issue.
